# Next.js Starter Project

This is a starter project for all of my future Next.js projects. It comes pre-configured with everything needed to kickstart a new project, including Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Husky, Prettier, NextUI, and Storybook 8.

## Getting Started

First, create a new project with this repository:

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/rinaldes/nextail-starter {app_name}
cd {app_name}
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

- **Next.js 14**: The latest version of Next.js for building server-side rendered React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in your JavaScript code.
- **Husky**: Git hooks made easy, ensuring code quality before commits.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter to maintain consistent code style.
- **NextUI**: A beautiful, fast, and modern React UI library.
- **Storybook 8**: A tool for developing UI components in isolation.

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev`: Run the development server.
- `pnpm build`: Build the application for production.
- `pnpm start`: Start the production server.
